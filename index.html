        <h2>Digestive System</h2>
        <span class="p">
          Your meal travels an amazing distance through your body, from top to
          bottom (your mouth to your anus). The healthy components of your food
          are absorbed along the process, providing you with nutrients and
          energy. Here is a detailed explanation of how the digestive system
          functions.
        </span>
        <h2>What is the digestive system?</h2>
        <span class="p">
          Your digestive system is a group of organs that aids in food digestion
          and nutrient absorption. Your biliary system and gastrointestinal (GI)
          tract are included. Your GI tract is made up of a network of
          interconnected hollow organs that extends from your mouth to your
          anus. Three organs make up your biliary system, which is a network
          responsible for delivering bile and enzymes to your GI tract through
          your bile ducts.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          Gastrointestinal (GI) tract The organs that make up your GI tract, in
          the order that they are connected, include your mouth, esophagus,
          stomach, small intestine, large intestine and anus. Biliary system
          Your biliary system includes your liver, gallbladder, pancreas and
          bile ducts
        </span>
        <h2>What does the digestive system do?</h2>
        <span class="p">
          Your digestive system is specially designed to carry out its function
          of converting food into the nutrients and energy you require to exist.
          After that, it conveniently compresses your solid waste, or stool, for
          disposal the next time you have a bowel movement.
        </span>
        <h2>Why is digestion important?</h2>
        <span class="p">
          Because your body needs the nutrients from the food you eat and the
          liquids you drink to keep healthy and function correctly, digestion is
          crucial. Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and
          water are all examples of nutrients. The nutrients in the food and
          drinks you ingest are broken down and absorbed by your digestive
          system for use in vital processes including cell growth, repair, and
          energy production.
