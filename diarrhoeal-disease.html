        <h2>Meaning</h2>
        <span class="p">
          •Diarrhoea is defined as passing three or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequently than is normal for the individual). Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under the age of five, killing approximately 525 000 children each year. Diarrhoea can linger for several days and deprive the body of the water and minerals it requires to survive. 
        </span>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <span class="p">
          •Diarrhoea is typically a symptom of an intestinal illness caused by a wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and parasitic species. Infection can spread via contaminated food or drinking water, or from person to person as a result of a lack of sanitation. It is the world's greatest cause of child death and morbidity, and is primarily caused by contaminated food and water sources.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •Water contaminated with human waste, such as that from sewage, septic tanks, or latrines, is of particular concern. Microorganisms that cause diarrhoea can also be found in animal feces. 
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •Dehydration is probably the most serious concern caused by diarrhoea. Water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate) are lost during a diarrhoeal episode through watery stools, vomit, sweat, urine, and respiration. When those nutrients are not restored, dehydration ensues.
        </span>
        <h2>There are three clinical types of diarrhoea:</h2>
        <span class="p">
          Acute watery diarrhoea – lasts several hours or days, and includes cholera;
        </span>
        <span class="p">
        Acute bloody diarrhoea – also called dysentery; 
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        Persistent diarrhoea – lasts 14 days or longer. 
      </span>

        <h2>PREVENTION OF DIARRHOEAL </h2>
        <span class="p">
          -Access to safe drinking-water;
       </span>
       <span class="p">
        -Use of improved sanitation;
     </span>
     <span class="p">
      -Hand washing with soap;
   </span>
   <span class="p">
    -Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life;
   </span>
   <span class="p">
    -Good personal and food hygiene;.
    </span>
    <span class="p">
    -Health education about how infections spread; and
    rotavirus vaccination.
    </span>
    <span class="p">
      -Oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution for rehydration. ORS is a combination of pure water, salt, and sugar. Each treatment costs only a few cents. The water and electrolytes lost in the feces are replaced by ORS, which is absorbed in the small intestine.
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        -Zinc supplements: zinc supplements are associated with a 30% reduction in stool volume and a 25% reduction in diarrhoea episode length. 
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          -Nutritious foods: The cycle of starvation and diarrhea can be broken by continuing to give nutrient-rich foods - including breast milk - during a period of illness, and by giving children a nutritious diet - including exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life - when they're healthy and good.
